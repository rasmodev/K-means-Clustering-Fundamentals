# K-means-Clustering-Fundamentals
This repository contains an example of using K-means clustering to partition data into distinct groups based on similarity.

## Introduction
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into a predefined number of clusters. It is widely used for various applications such as customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

In this example, we use the Scikit-learn library in Python to perform K-means clustering on a synthetic dataset. We visualize the clusters and centroids to understand how the algorithm groups data points based on their features.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

The script will generate a plot displaying the clusters identified by K-means clustering and their centroids. Adjustments to the number of clusters and dataset parameters can be made within the script to explore different scenarios.
